* Dcache is a library for [Dio ( http client for flutter )](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio). Dcache uses [sqflite](https://github.com/tekartik/sqflite) as disk cache and we thought memery cache is unnecessary. It is used in our product. It is fully testd and stable. Maybe it's useful for you too.
